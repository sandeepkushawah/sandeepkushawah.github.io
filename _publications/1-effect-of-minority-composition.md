Abstract: This paper investigates the effect of minority composition in a binary glass-forming liquid system. The study explores the structural and dynamic properties that govern the glass transition behavior at varying compositions. The findings provide insight into the molecular dynamics that contribute to the glass-forming ability of different systems.

Keywords: Binary Glass, Minority Composition, Glass Transition, Molecular Dynamics, Structural Properties, Dynamic Properties.
