Abstract: This molecular dynamic simulation study of a glass-forming binary mixture and FENE polymer sheds light on the structural origin of slow relaxation in these two glass formers. We show that the growth of the highest peak of the radial distribution function g(r), and variation in density relaxation, are correlated, which is related to the free volume available for density relaxation in the free volume theory; we also compare the growth of the surface density at the first peak to the Debye-Waller factor, which is also a representation of free volume is connected to the local density by a power law in the moderately supercooled regime in these two different systems.
