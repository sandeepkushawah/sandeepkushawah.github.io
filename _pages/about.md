I am Sandeep Kushawah, a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi (IIT Mandi), specializing in Soft Condensed Matter Physics. My research primarily focuses on simulation of glass transition phenomena in binary mixtures, particularly studying the dynamics of mobile and immobile particles in supercooled liquids using Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations.

Research Interests
======
My work explores the underlying mechanisms of glass formation and the role of structural heterogeneity in materials at different densities. Through the Kob-Andersen (KA) binary Lennard-Jones mixture model, I investigate the dynamic behavior of mobile clusters, strings, and particle interactions in supercooled liquids. Understanding these properties is crucial for advancing the design of new materials with improved stability and performance.

I also study mobile and immobile clusters, analyzing their formation and the relationship between structural properties and dynamical behavior. By modeling these systems, I aim to uncover the principles behind the glass transitionâ€”a phase transition that has important implications for various fields like material science, polymers, and bio-molecular systems.

Publications & Contributions
======
Over the course of my Ph.D., I have contributed to several publications related to the dynamics of supercooled liquids and glass transition phenomena. My research has been presented at conferences, including the 67th DAE Solid State Physics Symposium, and I have been awarded for my work, including the Best Poster Award at National Science Day 2024.
